1,"Hannah Arendt, you are the first woman to be presented in this series "
2,"in what's commonly considered a very masculine profession, "
3,This takes me to my first question. 
4,Do you see your role in the circle of philosophers 
5,"as something special, despite your received recognition and respect? "
6,Or did this emancipation issue never exist for you? 
7,I do not belong to the circle of philosophers. 
8,"My profession, if it can be spoken of at all, is political theory. "
9,I don't feel like a philosopher at all. 
10,"Nor do I think I've been accepted in the circle of philosophers, as you kindly say. "
11,But if we come to the other question that you raised: 
12,you say it's widely thought a masculine occupation. 
13,"Well, it does not have to remain a masculine occupation! "
14,It could well be that a woman will one day be a philosopher. 
15,"Well, I can't do anything about that. "
16,"In my opinion, I'm not a philosopher. "
17,I've said goodbye to philosophy for good. 
18,"I studied philosophy, as you know. "
19,But that doesn't mean that I stayed with it. 
20,— I'm glad we've come to this point. 
21,I would like to know more exactly where you see the difference between your work 
22,as a professor of political theory and political philosophy? 
23,Where do you see the difference? 
24,"When I think of a number of your works, like The Human Condition, "
25,I'd like to categorize you as a philosopher 
26,as long as you don't more precisely define for me the difference for you. 
27,
28,"The expression ""political philosophy"", which I avoid, "
29,is extremely burdened by tradition. 
30,"When I speak about these things, "
31,"academically or non-academically, "
32,I always mention that there is a tension between philosophy & politics. 
33,and man as an acting being. 
34,"There's a tension which in this sense doesn't exist, say, in natural philosophy. "
35,The philosopher faces nature like everyone else. 
36,"When he thinks about it, he speaks in the name of all humanity. "
37,But he cannot be neutral with regard to politics. Not since Plato! 
38,"There is a kind of hostility against all politics among most philosophers, "
39,with very few exceptions. Kant is an exception. 
40,SU temo N MRE. Caatitohy important for this whole area 
41,because it isn't a personal affair. 
42,It is in the nature of the subject itself. 
43,— You want no part of this hostility to politics 
44,because you think it would burden your work? 
45,"I want no part of the hostility, that is, I want "
46,to see politics with eyes which are to an extent unclouded by philosophy. 
47,Was this a problem for you? 
48,"Yeah, of course, there is always the problem as such. "
49,And I was actually old-fashioned. 
50,"I always thought that there are certain occupations that are improper for women, "
51,"that do not suit them, if I can put it like that. "
52,It does not look good when a woman gives orders. 
53,She should try not to get into such positions 
54,if she wants to retain feminine qualities. 
55,"I myself conformed to that, more or less unconsciously, or rather: consciously. "
56,The problem didn't play a role for me personally. 
57,"You see, I just did what I wanted to do. "
58,I never worried about whether I was a woman who did what men usually do. 
59,That didn’t matter to me personally. 
60,Your work — we will surely go into details later — 
61,is in significant parts aimed at the knowledge 
62,of the conditions under which political action & conduct come about. 
63,Do you want to achieve a broad impact with these works? 
64,Or do you believe such an impact is no longer possible in these times? 
65,Or is such an impact unimportant to you? 
66,"If I am to speak entirely honestly, "
67,"then when I'm working, I don't care about its impact. "
68,"And what is really important for me, "
69,"with the limitation that no one knows themselves, "
70,"that one shouldn't analyze oneself, "
71,one shouldn't do what I'm really doing now with you. 
72,
73,This understanding also includes writing for me. 
74,Writing is part of the process of understanding. 
75,"— When you write, does it further your own understanding? "
76,"Let's say that one had a very good memory, "
77,so that one could actually retain everthing one thinks: 
78,"I very much doubt I would've written anything, since I know my own laziness. "
79,"~ If you had such a memory? — Yeah, I don't. "
80,"That is, what matters to me is the thought process itself, personally. "
81,"When I have that, I am personally quite satisfied. "
82,"If I manage to succeed in expressing it adequately in writing, I'm also satisfied. "
83,"Now, you ask about the effect of my work. "
84,"If I may speak ironically, that is a masculine question. "
85,Men always want to be tremendously influential. 
86,I see this in a sense from the outside. 
87,"Do I see myself thus? No, I want to understand. "
88,"And when others understand in the same sense as I understood, "
89,"then it gives me satisfaction, like a sense of being at home. "
90,Do you write easily? Do you formulate thoughts easily? 
91,Sometimes. But in general I never write until I can dictate it to myself. 
92,"— Until you've thought it out? — Yes, I know what to write before. "
93,Usually I only write it down once. 
94,It just depends on how fast I type. 
95,"Today the central focus of your work is political theory, political action & conduct. "
96,In these circumstances it's especially interesting to me what I found 
97,"There you wrote, if may quote, "
98,"that you were ""neither interested in politics nor in history in your youth"". "
99,"Mrs. Arendt, you emigrated in 1933 from Germany as a Jew. You were 26. "
100,"the cessation of indifference to politics and history, "
101,have a connection to these everits? 
102,"I mean, we could discuss this at length. "
103,Indifference was no longer possible in 1933. 
104,"Yes, of course. "
105,I read the newspapers with suspense. I had opinions. 
106,I didn't belong to a party. I didn't need to then. 
107,By 1931 I was firmly convinced that the Nazis would come to power. 
108,And I was constantly arguing with others over these issues. 
109,But I really only dealt with these things systematically after I emigrated. 
110,I have another question about what you just said. 
111,Based on your conviction by 1931 
112,"that the Nazis could not be prevented from coming to power, "
113,didn't you feel compelled to actively do something by joining a party? 
114,Or did you no longer think it made sense? 
115,I personally didn't think it made sense. 
116,If I had thought it made sense — but it's very difficult to say in retrospect — 
117,then I might've done something. I thought it was hopeless. 
118,Is there a particular event in your memory 
119,
120,"Yes, in a sense, I'd say February 27, 1933, the burning of the Reichstag, "
121,and the illegal arrests that followed that same night. 
122,"As you know, people were taken to Gestapo cellars or concentration camps. "
123,And today it has often been overshadowed by later events. 
124,This was an immediate shock for me. 
125,And from that moment on I felt responsible. 
126,"That is, I no longer thought you can just sit back & watch. "
127,I tried to help with many things. 
128,But what actually led me out of Germany... 
129,I intended to emigrate anyway. 
130,I immediately thought that Jews could not stay. 
131,I had no intention of walking around Germany as a second-class citizen 
132,I also believed that things would get worse and worse. 
133,"Nevertheless, I did not finally leave in a peaceful way. "
134,"And I have to say, I felt some satisfaction. "
135,"I was arrested and had to leave the country illegally, I'll say how shortly, "
136,I had instant satisfaction. I thought at least I had done something! 
137,"At least I'm not ""innocent"". Nobody shall say that of me! "
138,"Well, the Zionist organization gave me the chance to leave at the time. "
139,"I was close friends with the leading people, especially then president, Kurt Blumenfeld. "
140,"Yet, in a certain sense I was influenced by them, "
141,"namely by the criticism, self-criticism "
142,which the Zionists spread among the Jewish people. 
143,I was influenced and impressed by that. 
144,But I had nothing to do with them politically. 
145,"Well, in 1933 Blumenfeld & someone whom you don't know approached me "
146,and told me they wanted to put together a collection 
147,of all the anti-Semitic statements made in ordinary circumstances. 
148,"Like statements made by teachers, all types of professional associations, "
149,"all kinds of professional journals, "
150,that which wasn't known abroad. 
151,To organize this collection then was what the Nazis called 'Horror Propaganda’. 
152,No Zionist would be able to do this. 
153,"Because if they were exposed, the entire organization would be exposed. "
154,"They asked if I'd do it. I said, sure. I was pleased. "
155,"First, it seemed quite sensible to me. "
156,"Second, I had the sense that something could be done after all. "
157,"Yeah, I was found out. I was very lucky. I got out after 8 days "
158,because I became friends with the officer who had arrested me. 
159,He had been promoted from the criminal police to a political division. 
160,"""Usually I have someone sitting in front of me,” "
161,
162,I told him fantastic stories. 
163,"And he kept saying: ""I brought you here, I'll get you out again."" "
164,"""Don't get a lawyer! Jews have no money now. Save your money!"" "
165,"Through members, of course. "
166,"Because the man who arrested me had such an open, decent face. I relied on him. "
167,I thought I had a much better chance than with a lawyer who was just afraid himself. 
168,"I got out, but had to cross the border illegally, since my name wasn't cleared. "
169,"In the correspondence mentioned before, Mrs. Arendt, "
170,you get a kind of reminder from Scholem: 
171,"""you should always be mindful of your affiliation with Jewish people"" "
172,which you clearly rejected as superfluous. That is: 
173,"""To be a Jew for me is one of the indubitable facts of my life."" "
174,"""I never wanted to change any such facts, not even in my childhood."" "
175,"That is, you make it clear that for you "
176,there never was something to question or that needed a reminder. 
177,I'd like to ask some questions about this. 
178,You were born in Hanover in 1906 as the daughter of an engineer 
179,what it was like for a kid in pre-war Germany to come from a Jewish family? 
180,I couldn't answer that question truthfully for the general public if I speak personally. 
181,"You see, first of all... "
182,I didn't know I was Jewish from my family. 
183,My mother was entirely non-religious. 
184,— Your father died young? — Right. 
185,It all sounds rather odd. My grandfather was president 
186,of a liberal Jewish community and city official of K6nigsberg. 
187,
188,"Nevertheless, the word 'Jew' was never used when I was a little kid. "
189,"I first encountered it via anti-Semitic remarks, that aren't worth recounting, "
190,
191,Did I feel like I was special? Yes. 
192,And I could no longer unravel that for you today. 
193,— In what way did you feel special? 
194,I think it was objectively related to being Jewish. 
195,"I knew, for example, as a kid, somewhat older now, "
196,"that I looked Jewish. That is, I looked different from others. "
197,But not in the form of an inferiority. 
198,"And then, my mother...my family home was a bit different than usual. "
199,"even compared to the other Jewish kids, "
200,"or even kids related to the family, "
201,But it certainly played a role. 
202,I'd like you to explain a bit about what made your family home special. 
203,there was never a need to explain your ethnicity until it happened on the street. 
204,Does that mean that the sense of being Jewish which 
205,"you claim for yourself in the letter to Scholem, was lost by your mother? "
206,Did it no longer play a role for her? 
207,Was there successful assimilation here? Or did your mother merely believe so? 
208,My mother was not very theoretical. 
209,I don't think she had any special ideas on this. 
210,"She herself came from the Social Democratic movement, "
211,"the circle of the Sozialistische Monatshefte, like my father. "
212,And the question played no role for her. 
213,"She was, of course, a Jew. She would've never baptized me! "
214,I suppose she would've slapped me left and right 
215,if she ever found out that I had denied being a Jew. 
216,"That was inconceivable, entirely out of the question! "
217,The question clearly played a greater role in the 20s when I was young than for her. 
218,"And for my mother later, when I grew up, it played a greater role than in earlier life. "
219,But that was due to external circumstances. 
220,"I, for example, don't think I've ever considered myself a German "
221,"in terms of ethnicity, not nationality, if one makes this distinction. "
222,"I recall heated discussions around 1930 with Jaspers on this, for instance. "
223,I didn't feel that it was anything inferior. 
224,And to come back to what was special about my family home. 
225,All Jewish children encountered anti-Semitism. 
226,And it poisoned the souls of many children. 
227,The difference with us was that 
228,my mother always thought that you must not cower. 
229,"So if, let's say, my teachers made anti-Semitic remarks, "
230,"mostly not about me, but other Jewish students, "
231,"such as eastern Jewish students, "
232,"then I was told to immediately get up, leave the class, come home, "
233,Then my mother wrote one of her many registered letters. 
234,I had a day off from school and that was nice! 
235,"But if it came from kids, I wasn't allowed to recount it at home. That did not apply. "
236,One defended oneself against what came from kids. 
237,So these things were never a problem for me. 
238,There were rules of conduct in which I retained my dignity. 
239,"ICMR ERE Reliae tat! at home, absolutely so. "
240,"You studied in Marburg, Heidelberg, and Freiburg "
241,"with professor Heidegger, Bultmann, and Jaspers. "
242,You majored in philosophy and minored in theology and Greek. 
243,How did this choice of study come about? 
244,"You know, I've often thought about that. "
245,I can only say: philosophy has been clear since I was 14. 
246,For me the question was somehow: 
247,"I can either study philosophy or drown myself, so to speak. "
248,"— Yes, this need to understand. "
249,"You see, all the books were at home... "
250,"— Besides Kant, do you recall any special reading experiences? "
251,"Yes, firstly, Jaspers's Psychology of World Views. "
252,I was 14 years old. 
253,It was linked in such a way that they both belonged together for me. 
254,I had no idea how to proceed. 
255,Greek is another matter. 
256,And poetry played a major role in my life. 
257,I added Greek because it was the most convenient. I read it anyway. 
258,Your intellectual talent was tested early. 
259,"As a young student, did this sometimes, perhaps painfully, "
260,separate you from the usual conduct of those around you? 
261,"You see, that would've been the case had I known it. "
262,I thought everyone was like that. 
263,— When did you realize your error? 
264,Quite late. I don't want to say when. 
265,I'm embarrassed. I was indescribably naive. 
266,It was partly due to my upbringing at home. 
267,Grades were never discussed at home. 
268,"In any case, it wasn't clear to me. "
269,I was sometimes aware of it as a sort of strangeness among people. 
270,
271,But it had nothing to do with talent. I never connected it to that. 
272,"Yeah, that happened very early on. "
273,I often suffered due to such disdain. 
274,"That is, knowing one really shouldn't and really must not, etc. "
275,"When you left Germany in 1933 you went to Paris, where you worked in an organization "
276,that tried to accommodate Jewish youth in Palestine. 
277,Can you say something about that? 
278,"I want to first say something about what this was. It was ""Youth Aliyah"". "
279,It was an organization founded in Germany by Recha Freier in 1932. 
280,Then in 1933 it got very large of course. 
281,And it was then led by Henrietta Szold in America. 
282,"Recha Freier in Germany, and Henrietta Szold in Palestine then. "
283,This organization brought Jewish youth 
284,between the age of 13-17 to Palestine from Germany 
285,and housed them there in kibbutzim. 
286,That's why I know these settlements relatively well. 
287,— And from a very early period. — Right. 
288,And I had a lot of respect for them back at that time. 
289,The kids received vocational training & educational training. 
290,"Now, in France the situation was that when the refugee kids were 14 years old "
291,"and they finished school, they weren't allowed to work or get vocational training. "
292,"As a result, certificates were sent to France for refugee children. "
293,"And I smuggled Polish children here and there, "
294,because of the preference for those from Germany. 
295,And I did that with great pleasure. 
296,"It was regular social work, educational work. "
297,"There were large camps in the country where the kids prepared, "
298,"where they also had lessons, learned to farm, and above all had to gain weight. "
299,We had to dress them from head to toe. Cook for them. 
300,"We especially had to get papers for them, deal with the parents. "
301,
302,"More than anything, we had to get them money. That was largely left to me. "
303,I worked together with French women. 
304,But do you want to hear about how I came to this work at all? 
305,"You see, I came from a purely academic background. "
306,"And in that respect, 1933 left a very lasting impression on me. "
307,"First a positive one, then a negative. "
308,"Or perhaps I should say: first a negative, then positive. "
309,Today it is often thought that the shock of German Jews in 1933 
310,is explained by Hitler seizing power. 
311,"Now, as far as I and my generation are concerned, "
312,I can say that this is a curious misunderstanding. 
313,"That was, of course, very awful. But it was political, not personal. "
314,"My god, we didn't need Hitler to come to power to know the Nazis were our enemies! "
315,That was completely clear for at least 4 years to anyone who was not an idiot! 
316,We also knew a large number of Germans were behind them. 
317,That couldn't shock or surprise us in 1933. 
318,"No, not only that. But that too. "
319,"First, the generally political became a personal fate when one emigrated. "
320,Second was 'co-ordination' (enforced conformity) of friends: they got in line. 
321,"The problem, the personal problem, never was what enemies did, but what friends did. "
322,"In the wave of 'co-ordination', that was relatively voluntary then, "
323,"at least not yet under the pressure of terror, "
324,"but in the sudden abandonment, it was as if a void formed around one. "
325,"Now, I lived in an intellectual milieu. "
326,And not among the others. 
327,"I left Germany dominated by one idea, obviously a bit exaggerated: "
328,I'll never again get involved In any intellectual business. 
329,I want nothing to do with this community. 
330,T also did not think that German Jews & German Jewish intellectuals 
331,would've acted any differently if their own situation had been different. 
332,I thought it had to do with the profession. 
333,I speak in the past tense. I know more today. 
334,— I wanted to ask if you still believe that. 
335,"Well, no longer to the same degree. "
336,But I think that it belongs to the essence an intellectual 
337,"that one fabricates ideas about everything, so to speak. "
338,No one ever blamed someone who ‘co-ordinated' to take care of their family. 
339,"For a short time, many very short. "
340,"That is, they made up ideas about Hitler. "
341,And in part tremendously interesting things! 
342,"Completely fantastic, interesting & complex things! "
343,And things far above the ordinary level! 
344,"they were trapped by their own ideas, I would say today. "
345,That's why it was so important for you to leave these circles 
346,"which you absolutely wanted to say goodbye to at that time, "
347,and turn from academic work to more practical-social work? 
348,"Yes, the positive side is the following. "
349,Back then I kept repeating a phrase I remembered: 
350,"""If one is attacked as a Jew, one must defend oneself as a Jew."" "
351,"""Not as German or world citizen, or human rights defender, or whatever."" "
352,"""But specifically, what can I do [as a Jew]?"" "
353,"Second, I definitely wanted to work with an organization. "
354,"And to work with the Zionists, as they were the only ones prepared. "
355,"I mean, it was pointless with the assimilated. "
356,I never really had much to do with them. 
357,I dealt with the Jewish question before. 
358,My book on Rahel Varnhagen was finished when I left Germany. 
359,And the Jewish problem plays a role there. 
360,— This work was for an humanitarian community? 
361,I got a grant from an association. 
362,"But at the time I also wrote it with the idea: ""I want to understand"". "
363,ERB Ie mel Rete tas rth personal Jewish problem. 
364,I was not discussing my personal Jewish problem. 
365,"But what was my own problem? It was political, purely political. "
366,I wanted to do practical work and only Jewish work. 
367,— Until 1940? — Yes. 
368,You then arrived in America during WWII 
369,"where today you are professor of political theory, not philosophy. "
370,You work in Chicago and live in New York. 
371,"Your husband, whom you married in 1940, "
372,is also a professor of philosophy in America. 
373,"Now the academic province to which you again belong, "
374,"after the disillusionment of 1933, is international. "
375,"Yet I want to ask if you miss pre-Hitler Europe, which will never exist again. "
376,"When you're in America or you come to Europe, "
377,what remains and what is irretrievably lost? 
378,Pre-Hitler Europe? I do not long for that. 
379,
380,
381,I've always deliberately refused to lose my mother tongue. 
382,I've always kept a certain distance 
383,"from French, which I spoke very well, "
384,"and English, which I write in today. "
385,"I write in English, but have a distance from it. "
386,There's a huge difference between a mother tongue & all other languages. 
387,For myself I can put it very simply: 
388,In German I know a rather large part of German poetry by heart. 
389,I can never achieve that again. 
390,I say things in German that I wouldn't let myself say in English. 
391,"Sometimes I do it in English too, because I've become bold. "
392,But in general I've kept distance. 
393,The German language is the essential thing that has remained 
394,and also what I've always consciously kept. 
395,— Even in the most bitter time? — Always. 
396,
397,It wasn't the German language that went crazy! 
398,"Second, there's no substitute for one's mother tongue. "
399,That's true. I've seen it. 
400,Then there are people who speak the foreign language better than you do. 
401,I still speak with a very strong accent. 
402,"And I often don't speak idiomatically, as is said. "
403,They can do all that. But it becomes a language where one cliché chases another 
404,because the actual productivity that one has in one's own language 
405,is cut off when one forgets that language. 
406,"— In the cases where one's mother tongue is forgotten, "
407,
408,"Yes, very often. I've seen it in people due to shock. "
409,"You see, what was decisive wasn't 1933, at least not for me. "
410,What was decisive was the day we learned about Auschwitz. 
411,And we didn't believe it at first. 
412,"Although my husband & I always said the Nazis were capable of anything, "
413,we didn't believe it because it was militarily unnecessary & uncalled for. 
414,My husband is a former military historian and understands a bit about these things. 
415,"He said, don't be gullible, don't believe such stories. They cannot go that far! "
416,And that was the real shock. 
417,"Before that one said: well, you have enemies. "
418,That's natural. Why shouldn't a people have enemies? 
419,But this was different. It was really like an abyss had opened. 
420,Because we had the idea that amends could somehow be made for all else. 
421,Amends can be made for just about everything at some point in politics. 
422,This never should have happened. 
423,I don't just mean the number of victims. 
424,I mean the manufacture of the corpses and so on. I don't need to go into it. 
425,Something happened there to which we can't reconcile ourselves. 
426,"With everything else that happened, I must say, it was sometimes a bit difficult, "
427,"we were very poor, we were hunted down, "
428,"we had to flee, we had to find a way to get through, etc. That's how it was. "
429,We were young. We even had a little fun with it. I can't deny that. 
430,But not this. This was Oa ea R meena 
431,
432,"I'd like to hear how your opinion of post-war Germany, "
433,has changed since 1945? 
434,"I returned to Germany for the first time in 1949, "
435,Mainly books. 
436,An organization where I was then the executive director. 
437,My reflection since 1945 were the following. 
438,Whatever happened in 1933 is really not important in light of what happened later. 
439,"Certainly, the disloyalty of friends, if I may put it bluntly... "
440,— You experienced it personally? — Of course. 
441,"You see, if someone really became a Nazi and wrote articles about it, "
442,he didn't have to be loyal to me. I didn't speak to him again anyway. 
443,"He didn't have to contact me anymore, he was cut off. Clearly. "
444,"There were people who just fell into their own trap, as I'd say today. "
445,that precisely in this abyss there should be a basis [for communication]. 
446,And that was also the case in many personal relations. 
447,I argued with people. I'm not very agreeable or polite. | speak my mind. 
448,"As I said, these were all people who "
449,did things for a few months or at worst a few years. 
450,"Not murderers or informers. As I said, people who made up ideas about Hitler. "
451,But the greatest experience when one returns to Germany 
452,"apart from the experience of recognition, "
453,which is always the crux of the act in Greek tragedy... 
454,The greatest experience is one of emotional upheaval. 
455,Second was that German was spoken on the street. That pleased me beyond words. 
456,— This reaction was in 1949? — More or less. 
457,"And today, now that things are back on track, "
458,"And today, now that things are back on track, "
459,the distance has become greater than when in that emotional upheaval. 
460,— Because the conditions in the country got back on track too fast in your view? 
461,— Yeah and often on a track which I don't approve of. 
462,
463,"That is, I'm far less involved than I was then. "
464,It could also be due to the lapse of time. 15 years is not nothing! 
465,"But would you say, to summarize it in one expression as far as possible, "
466,"Yeah, distance. Indifference is too strong. But there's distance. "
467,This fall your book on the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem was published in West Germany. 
468,This work has been very fiercely debated since its publication in the U.S. 
469,The Jewish side especially has raised objections against the book that you say 
470,are partly due to misunderstandings and also a controlled political campaign. 
471,"Above all, people were upset by the question you raised about "
472,"the extent the Jews are to blame for their passive acceptance in the murder campaign, "
473,"or what is the more significant part in the book, "
474,to what extent the collaboration of certain Jewish councils 
475,is almost a kind of complicity of its own. 
476,"In any case, for a portrait of Hannah Arendt, "
477,it seems to me there are several questions that arise from this book. 
478,A Rem oly sta esi Is it painful for you 
479,that your book is accused of a lack of love for the Jewish people? 
480,"First of all, let me say, TIME UM ca Coren ote "
481,you yourself have been a victim of this campaign. 
482,Nowhere in my book did I accuse the Jewish people of not resisting. 
483,"Namely, Mr. Haussner of the Israeli public prosecutor's office. "
484,I called the questions he directed at the witnesses in Jerusalem: 
485,But some of the accusations against you are based on 
486,aim ROT UOMUANTCe Tm IECOh a OER hdcwe-Teomn ae LAK te 
487,I can't say anything against that. And I don't want to. 
488,
489,Or let's put it differently. I don't want to get combative. 
490,"— You get combative? — No, what's the point? "
491,"Look, there are people who take offense. "
492,"That is, I can still laugh. "
493,And I really thought that Eichmann was a clown. 
494,"I read his police interrogation, 3,600 pages, and very carefully. "
495,And I don't know how many times I laughed out loud! 
496,"Now, this reaction offended people. "
497,I cannot help that. But I do know one thing. 
498,The tone is largely ironic. 
499,The tone is really the person in this case. 
500,"So when people reproach me with accusing the Jewish people, "
501,that is a malicious propaganda lie and nothing else. 
502,"The tone, however, is an objection against me personally. I can't help that. "
503,What are you supposed to do? You cannot do anything. 
504,I can't tell people: you misunderstand me and in my heart is really this or that. 
505,"In this context, I'd like to go back to a personal statement you made. "
506,"""I've never in my life loved any people or collective group,"" "
507,"""neither Germans, nor French, nor Americans,"" "
508,"""In fact, I only love my friends."" "
509,"""I'm entirely incapable of any other kind of love.” "
510,"""In particular, the love of the Jews"" "
511,"""would be suspect since I am myself Jewish."" "
512,"As justified & respectable as this attitude may be, "
513,"does not man, as a politically active being, need a commitment to a group? "
514,A commitment that can then to some extent be called love? 
515,Do you not worry that your attitude could be politically sterile? 
516,"No, I'd say the other is politically sterile. "
517,We could have a long colloquium on this. 
518,"To belong to a group, in the first place, is a natural condition. "
519,
520,"Now, to belong to a group in this second sense you mean, "
521,that’s something entirely different. 
522,This organization of people has to do with one's relation to the world. 
523,become organized have in common what are ordinarily called interests. 
524,"Thus what lies between them, that truly involves a relation to the world. "
525,"The direct personal relationship in which one can speak of love, "
526,"that exists, of course, first and foremost in real love, "
527,"and secondly, it exists in a sense in friendship too. "
528,"Here a person is addressed directly, independent of their relation to the world. "
529,can still be personal friends. 
530,"But if one confuses these things, "
531,"if one brings love to the negotiating table, "
532,And I really find it to be a very great disaster. 
533,And I admit that the Jewish people are a prime example of 
534,a worldless people who maintained themselves for thousands of years. 
535,— 'World' is understood in your terminology as the realm for politics? 
536,— As the realm for politics and also the public realm. 
537,— Jews were an apolitical people? 
538,"I wouldn't exactly say that, since the communities were naturally also political. "
539,BU het) canes (onl is a national religion. 
540,"One can't say ‘apolitical’, but it's only political with very great restrictions. "
541,"This worldnessless that the Jewish people suffered in being dispersed, "
542,"as with all people who are pariahs, "
543,
544,This changed the moment when Israel was founded. 
545,"Actually, it already did with the national Jewish home in Palestine. "
546,— Has something been lost which you regret? 
547,"Yes, you pay dearly for freedom. "
548,The specific Jewish humanity [signified by their lack of a homeland] 
549,The specific Jewish humanity [signified by their lack of a homeland] 
550,was quite beautiful. You're too young to have experienced it. But it was lovely. 
551,This standing outside all social connections. 
552,"which I experienced very strongly with my mother, "
553,who also practiced it in relation to the whole Jewish community. 
554,All that charm was of course lost. 
555,—I said in my Lessing speech: — 1959. 
556,This humanity hasn't survived the day of liberation by as much as 5 minutes. 
557,"You see, that also happened to us. "
558,No. I know you have to pay a price for freedom. 
559,"Mrs. Arendt, if you acquire knowledge via political-philosophical speculation "
560,do you feel so committed to it that it is your duty to publish it? 
561,Or do you recognize reasons to be silent about a known truth? 
562,"Yes, that's a very difficult problem. "
563,At bottom that's the only question 
564,which interested me in the whole controversy over the Eichmann book. 
565,But it's a question that never arose unless I broached it. 
566,It's the only serious question. All else is pure propaganda soup. 
567,"""Let truth be told, though the world may perish""? "
568,"Well, the Eichmann book did not de facto touch upon such things. "
569,The book basically did not actually jeopardize anyone's legitimate interests. 
570,"Yeah, you're right. "
571,What counts as 'legitimate' is open to discussion. 
572,I probably mean something different by MTL ebeeE Comm ASL VOM AICIN oh SESIMC Ee LEAT SCOT e 
573,I probably mean something different by ‘legitimate’ than the Jewish organization. 
574,"one's genuine interests, which even I recognize, were at play. "
575,— Can one then be silent about a recognized truth? 
576,Would I have done so? I would've written it... 
577,"if I had anticipated this or that, "
578,would I not have written the Eichmann book differently? 
579,I would've faced the alternative: to write or not to write. 
580,You can hold your tongue. You don't always have to speak. 
581,But now we come to the question 
582,"ILM TT mem Rls e were called ""truths of fact"". "
583,"This case is really a matter of truths of fact, not of opinion. "
584,Historical sciences are the guardians of these truths of fact in the universities. 
585,They're controlled by the state. 
586,I was told that a historian remarked about a book on the origins of WWI: 
587,"""I won't let it spoil the memory of such an uplifting time!"" "
588,So that is a man who doesn't know who he is. But that's uninteresting. 
589,"De facto he is the guardian of historical truths, the truths of fact. "
590,"And we know how important these guardians are, "
591,"for example, from Bolshevik history, where history is rewritten every 5 years. "
592,"And the facts remain unknown, such as there was a Mr. Trotsky. "
593,Is this what we want? Is this what governments have an interest in? 
594,— Perhaps. But do they have that right? 
595,They don't appear to believe they do themselves. 
596,Otherwise they wouldn't tolerate universities at all. 
597,"So, even states themselves have an interest in the truth. "
598,I don't mean military secrets. That's a different matter. 
599,"Well, these events go back about 20 years. "
600,"Yeah, some say that. "
601,And others say that after 20 years one no longer can find out the truth. 
602,"In any case, there is an interest in whitewashing. "
603,But that isn't a legitimate interest. 
604,"Thus, in case of doubt, you would prefer the truth? "
605,"I would say that impartiality, which came into the world when Homer... "
606,"— ""For the conquered as well"" — Yes! ""If the voices of song are silent"" "
607,That's what Homer did. 
608,"""the great deeds of the Greeks and the barbarians..."" "
609,"All science comes from this spirit, "
610,even modern science and also history. 
611,If one is incapable of this impartiality 
612,because one pretends to love one's own people so much that 
613,— One conceals the truth? — Yes or constantly flatters... 
614,"one constantly pays flattering homage to them, "
615,then nothing can be done. I don't think people like that are patriots. 
616,"In one of your most important works, The Human Condition, "
617,you come to the conclusion that the modern period has 
618,"dethroned the community spirit, i.e. the prime sense of importance of the political. "
619,You designate as modern social phenomena 
620,"the uprooting and loneliness of the masses, "
621,and the triumph of a type of person who 
622,I have two questions about this. 
623,"First, to what extent are such philosophical insights "
624,dependent on personal experiences which get the thought process going? 
625,I don't think any thought process is possible without personal experience. 
626,"That is, every thought is an afterthought, "
627,a reflection on some matter or event. 
628,And obviously my experiences are in and of the modern world. 
629,"This, by the way, has been pointed out by many others. "
630,"You see, the matter of labor and consumption "
631,"on my account are only two sides of the same phenomenon, "
632,"that is, this cycle in which life oscillates, "
633,That again is the reason why it's so 
634,"important, and it seems to me, ominous "
635,because a kind of worldlessness could again form itself there. 
636,It no longer matters how the world appears. 
637,—'World' always understood as the space in which politics can occur? 
638,I understand it now in a wider sense: 
639,"as the space in which one lives, "
640,"in which art of course appears, "
641,in which all kinds of things appear. 
642,You remember Kennedy had tried 
643,to expand the public space by inviting 
644,poets and good-for-nothings into the White House. 
645,So that it all could belong to this space. 
646,"In labor and consumption though, man is utterly thrown back on himself. "
647,On the biological and on himself. 
648,And there you have the connection with loneliness. 
649,In the process of labor a curious loneliness arises. 
650,"I can't go into that now, it would take us too far afield. "
651,"And this loneliness consists in being thrown back upon oneself, "
652,"where, in a sense, consumption takes the place of all truly relating activities. "
653,you come to the conclusion that 
654,"""truly world oriented experiences” "
655,meaning insights & experiences of the highest political status 
656,"eater eter tetera tierce ite  the experiential horizon of the average human existence."" "
657,"This most important aspect of human existence, "
658,"as you say, ""the ability to act"", ""1s today restricted to a few."" "
659,What does this mean in practical terms of politics? 
660,To what extent in these circumstances does a form of government theoretically 
661,based on the co-responsibility of all citizens become a fiction? 
662,"You see, first of all, "
663,this inability to be truly oriented 
664,"applies not only to the masses, but every other stratum of society. "
665,"encircled by an army of experts, "
666,"And actually, the question of action here "
667,is between the statesman and the experts. 
668,The statesman has to make the final decision. 
669,"He can hardly do that realistically, since he can't know everything himself. "
670,from experts who in principle 
671,always must contradict each other. 
672,Every reasonable statesman gets opposing expert opinions. 
673,He has to judge between them. 
674,And this judging is a extremely mysterious process 
675,in which the community spirit is then to be expressed. 
676,"Now, as far as the masses are concerned, I would say: "
677,"it doesn't matter the size, "
678,and the public sphere is formed. 
679,"And in America, where there are still these spontaneous associations, "
680,Some public interests concern 
681,or some other sort of group. 
682,Then these people will get together and be very good 
683,at being able to act publicly in these matters since they oversee them. 
684,"That is, what you said only applies to the greatest decisions at the highest level. "
685,"And there, believe me, the difference between the statesman "
686,"You don't have to believe me, I only said it rhetorically. "
687,"Ms. Arendt, Karl Jaspers is your former teacher who "
688,you've been particularly close with as a constant dialogue partner among friends. 
689,What do you think is the greatest influence Jaspers has had on you? 
690,
691,an unconditionality of speaking 
692,that I've never known in another person. 
693,
694,He also has a concept of freedom linked to reason 
695,which was completely foreign to me when I came to Heidelberg. 
696,
697,"I saw this reason in action, so to speak. "
698,"If I may say so, I grew up without a father, and I was educated by it. "
699,"Or if you like...I don't want to make him responsible for me for God's sake, "
700,"Or if you like...I don't want to make him responsible for me for God's sake, "
701,then this was Karl Jaspers. 
702,"And this dialogue, of course, is very different today. "
703,That was actually my most powerful post-war experience. 
704,In a speech on Jaspers you said: 
705,"""Humanity is never acquired in solitude"" "
706,"“and never by giving one's work over to the public."" "
707,"""Only by throwing one's life & person into the venture into the public sphere"" "
708,means what to Hannah Arendt? 
709,One exposes oneself 
710,"to the light of the public, as a person. "
711,Although I am of the opinion that 
712,"one must not self-consciously appear and act in public, "
713,still I know that in every action the person 
714,is expressed in a way like no other 
715,— like no other activity. 
716,So that's one venture. The second is: 
717,"we weave our thread in a network of relationships, "
718,We've all been taught to say: 
719,This is true of all action. 
720,"Quite simply and concretely true, "
721,this venture is only possible
